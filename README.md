# Energy-Exergy Analysis Engine

**Comprehensive thermodynamic modeling for diverse energy systems through unified energy-exergy analysis**

A Python library that enables simultaneous energy (first-law) and exergy (second-law) analysis of various energy conversion systems. Built for researchers, engineers, and educators who need to understand not just how much energy flows through a system, but also the quality and potential of that energy.

## Why Energy-Exergy Analysis?

Traditional energy analysis tells you _how much_ energy is used, but not _how well_ it's used. Exergy analysis reveals the true thermodynamic efficiency by accounting for energy quality and identifying where irreversibilities occur. Together, energy-exergy analysis provides:

- **Complete thermodynamic picture**: Understand both quantity (energy) and quality (exergy) of energy flows
- **Inefficiency identification**: Pinpoint where and why energy is being destroyed
- **Technology comparison**: Fair comparison between different energy conversion technologies
- **Optimization guidance**: Identify the most promising areas for system improvement

This library makes energy-exergy analysis accessible by providing ready-to-use models for common energy systems, with automatic calculation of energy, entropy, and exergy balances.

## Core Capabilities

### Unified Balance Calculations

Every component model automatically calculates three balances:

1. **Energy Balance** (First Law of Thermodynamics): Identifies energy flows and losses
2. **Entropy Balance** (Second Law of Thermodynamics): Quantifies irreversibilities
3. **Exergy Balance** (Both First and Second Law of Thermodynamics): Reveals thermodynamic inefficiencies

These balances are calculated consistently across all components, enabling system-level analysis and comparison.

### Analysis Features

- **Automatic balance calculation**: Set parameters, run `system_update()`, get all balances
- **Subsystem-level analysis**: Detailed balances for each subsystem (e.g., combustion chamber, heat exchanger, mixing valve)
- **Performance metrics**: Exergy efficiency, COP, and other key performance indicators
- **Visualization support**: Built-in functions for displaying balance results
- **Unit conversion utilities**: Comprehensive unit conversion functions for all common physical quantities

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Electric Boiler System

```python
from enex_analysis_engine import ElectricBoiler, print_balance

# Initialize system
boiler = ElectricBoiler()

# Set operating conditions
boiler.T_w_tank = 60   # Tank temperature [°C]
boiler.T_w_sup = 10    # Supply water temperature [°C]
boiler.T_w_serv = 45   # Service water temperature [°C]
boiler.dV_w_serv = 1.2 # Flow rate [L/min]
boiler.T0 = 0          # Reference temperature [°C]

# Run analysis
boiler.system_update()

# View results
print(f"Energy input: {boiler.E_heater:.2f} W")
print(f"Exergy efficiency: {boiler.X_eff:.4f}")

# Print detailed balances
print("\n=== Energy Balance ===")
print_balance(boiler.energy_balance)

print("\n=== Exergy Balance ===")
print_balance(boiler.exergy_balance)
```
